# Protect Animals - Minecraft Fabric mod

Removes some damage sources to animals, and named animals (including allays) never take damage.

Specific changes:
- Axolotls don't "dry out" - they don't take damage from being out of water for too long.
- Bees ONLY take damage from players and other mobs. In particular, they won't take damage from water.
- Water animals do not "drown" when out of water.
